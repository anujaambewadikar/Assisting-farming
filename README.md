# Assisting-farming
Build and evaluate a machine learning model for assisting farmers by weather forecasting. The built model achieving a successful growth of crops both in terms of quality and quantity. Crop yield prediction with machine learning also helps farmers in planning the logistics of their business 

About the choosen dataset:
Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. Using this dataset we build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.
